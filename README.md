# STM32_Course
Hi! This repo is made to track my progress and record most interesting things i learn through the course.
I am learning with the help of the Forbot blog who made this course: https://forbot.pl/blog/kurs-stm32-l4-wstep-spis-tresci-dla-kogo-jest-ten-kurs-id48575
I follow them for a time, and consider them one of best source of information regarding DIY electronics.
As for enviorement, I've decided to utilize Stm32CubeMX software for generating basic framework with initialized MCU peripherals chosed via GUI. Then using stm32pio plugin (https://github.com/ussserrr/stm32pio) integrate it to VsCode PlatformIO enviorement, as i find it most comfortable IDE to write code in.
